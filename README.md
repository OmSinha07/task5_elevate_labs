# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🎯 Objective
Perform visual and statistical exploration of the Titanic dataset to extract insights about survival patterns, passenger demographics, and feature relationships.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: Titanic dataset (train.csv)
- Records: 891 passengers
- Columns: 12 (including survival status, class, age, fare, etc.)

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in EDA

### A. Basic Exploration
- .info(), .describe(), .value_counts() for dataset structure and basic stats.

### B. Univariate Analysis
- Histograms of numerical features to understand distributions.

### C. Outlier Detection
- Boxplots for Age vs Survived and Fare vs Pclass.

### D. Bivariate Analysis
- Pairplot to analyze relationships between numerical features and survival.

### E. Correlation
- Heatmap of numeric columns to reveal feature correlations.

### F. Summary
- Survival is higher in females and 1st class passengers.
- Fare and Pclass show strong relationship with survival.
- Cabin has many missing values; Age also needs imputation.

---

## 📈 Outcome
- Developed skills in visualizing patterns and discovering trends.
- Ready to apply these insights in preprocessing and model building.

---

## 📄 Deliverables
- titanic_eda_task5.py – Python script containing full EDA
- Jupyter Notebook version (if converted)
- PDF report (optional)

---

## ❓ Interview Preparation
- What is EDA and why is it important?
- Which plots help detect correlation?
- How do you handle skewed data?
- How to detect multicollinearity?
- Univariate vs Bivariate vs Multivariate analysis
- Difference between heatmap and pairplot
